We worked on the project ‘Adverse Impact Analysis – Online Calculator’, initiated by Dr. Shriram Venkatraman, Assistant Professor of Anthropology, Department of Social Sciences and Humanities, IIIT-Delhi.

Using various statistical tools like Adverse Impact, Chi-Square, Standard Deviation, Confidence Interval, and Probability Distribution.

This analysis is done for different fields like #Race/Ethnicity (for each EEO Codes), #Gender, and #Age, under any employment desicions like Selection, Promotion, Demotion, or Termination.
